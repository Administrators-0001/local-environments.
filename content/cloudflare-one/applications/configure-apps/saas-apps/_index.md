# Add a SaaS application to Access

Cloudflare Access allows you to add an additional authentication layer to your SaaS applications. When you integrate a SaaS application with Access, users log in to the application with Cloudflare as the Single Sign-On provider. The user is then redirected to the configured identity providers for that application and are only granted access if they pass your Access policies.

## Add a SaaS application

Cloudflare integrates with the majority of SaaS applications that support the SAML or OIDC authentication protocol. If you do not see your application listed below, refer to our generic SAML or generic OIDC guide and consult your SaaS application's documentation.

[SCIM provisioning](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/scim/) allows you to synchronize users and groups between your identity provider (IdP) and SaaS application. Once configured, SCIM will automatically grant a user access to all the SaaS applications they need to do their job once they have been added to the IdP. Each SaaS application has different SCIM setup requirements, and some applications may not support all of the SCIM functionality available in Zero Trust.

### Prerequisites

- [Add a SaaS application](#add-a-saas-application) to Zero Trust
- Add a [supported IdP](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/scim/#supported-identity-providers) to Zero Trust
- Enable SCIM provisioning between your IdP and Zero Trust. Refer to our [IdP setup guides](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/) for details.

### 1. Obtain SaaS application settings

Get the following information from your SaaS application account:

- **Remote URL**: The SCIM server URL for your SaaS application, for example `https://<your-domain>/scim/v2`
- **Credentials**: The SCIM authentication credentials used by your SaaS application (Bearer Token, HTTP Basic, or OAuth 2.0)

### 2. Configure SCIM in Zero Trust

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Access** > **Applications**.
2. Select the SaaS application that you want to enable SCIM provisioning for, and select **Edit**.
3. In the **Authentication** tab, turn on **SCIM provisioning**.
4. Select your IdP.
5. In **Remote URL**, enter the SCIM server URL obtained from your SaaS application account.
6. Select the credential type compatible with your SaaS application.
7. Enter the authentication credentials obtained from your SaaS application account.
8. Select **Verify credentials**.
9. (Optional) Configure [advanced provisioning settings](#advanced-provisioning-settings).
10. Select **Save application**.

Cloudflare will begin synchronizing users and groups between your IdP and the SaaS application according to the provisioning schedule set in your IdP. To track how the user's identity changes over time, view your [User Registry audit logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/users/).

### Advanced provisioning settings

#### User synchronization

- **User event handling**: Choose the user creation/update/deletion events that you want Cloudflare to forward from the IdP to the SaaS application.
- **Filter**: You can enter a [SCIM filter expression](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) that matches the IdP users you want to synchronize with the SaaS application. For example,
    ```txt
    email co "@mycompany.com and active eq true"
    ```
    To synchronize all IdP users, leave this field blank.
- **Transformation**: You can enter a [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) script that modifies user identities from the IdP before they are provisioned to the SaaS application. This is useful for setting defaults, excluding email addresses, or ensuring usernames meet arbitrary criteria. For example,

    ```json
    {
      "transformations": {
        "mapUserName": "$.employeeId",
        "mapEmail": "$.email",
        "mapRole": "$.role",
        "mapDepartment": "$.department",
        "mapStatus": "$.status"
      }
    }
    ```

#### Group synchronization

- **Group event handling**: Choose the group creation/update/deletion events that you want Cloudflare to forward from the IdP to the SaaS application.
- **Filter**:  You can enter a [SCIM filter expression](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) that matches the IdP groups you want to synchronize with the SaaS application. For example, `displayName eq "Marketing"`. To synchronize all IdP groups, leave this field blank.
- **Transformation**: You can enter a [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) script that modifies groups from the IdP before they are provisioned to the SaaS application.

#### Deletion handling

Choose what happens to users and groups in the SaaS application when they are deleted from your IdP.
  - **Delete users and groups** removes them from the application.
  - **Disable users and groups** deactivates them in the application. Select this option if your SaaS application does not allow resource deletion.
