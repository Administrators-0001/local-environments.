C3 will ask if you would like to deploy your project to Cloudflare. Deploying is optional.

- If you choose to deploy, you will be asked to authenticate (if not logged in already), and your project will be deployed to the Cloudflare global network.

- If you choose not to deploy, the project will be created for you locally, and you will be able to deploy at a later time.
