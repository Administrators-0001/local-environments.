Running `npm create cloudflare@latest` will prompt you to install the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) package, and lead you through a setup wizard. After you have entered the setup wizard, you will be asked which type of application you would like to create. The list of applications includes a variety of Workers templates as well as an option to select a web framework to create a website or web application. C3 will also install [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/), the Cloudflare Developer Platform CLI.
