{{<Aside type="note">}}

Version 2 of Wrangler supports [environments](/workers/platform/environments/) from version 1. We are currently working on support for [Service Environments](/workers/learning/using-services/). Refer to [Wrangler environments](/workers/platform/environments/) for more information.
