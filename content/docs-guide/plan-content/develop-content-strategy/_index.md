# Develop your content strategy

Similarly to how applications have specific files for designated purposes, documentation sites have specific types of content for specific purposes. A content strategy details those content types, what their unique purpose is, and what components are used within a content type. A content strategy can also include the your documentation site's information architecture and the voice and tone you use throughout your documentation.

Content strategy ensures that the documentation you create is consistent, which helps improve SEO. Using the same page structure every time you create a how-to article helps more than your users - it also helps search engines quickly make sense of what's on a page and prioritize which pages to rank highest.
