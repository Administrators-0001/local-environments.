# How we do it

Cloudflare documentation's origin story is similar to many out there - our support team needed a way to quickly answer the most common customer questions, so we created content as-needed in a support-focused knowledge base.  Over time, the Product organization realized that having a team of technical writers within the Product team could help explain products to our users and answer questions before customers even had them. That's how Cloudflare's Product Content Experience (PCX) team came about.

We mention our documentation team's evolution because PCX created our content strategy after years of how-tos, FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and tutorials existed in our knowledge base. We had a pretty good idea of what types of information our users needed to successfully use their Cloudflare products. We just had to create the templates and guidelines to introduce consistency.

For more information on our content types and component attributes, refer to the [Developer documentation content strategy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/) section of our [Cloudflare Docs Style Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/).
