The following example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [pgEdge](https://pgedge.com/) Postgres database. pgEdge Cloud provides easy deployment of fully-managed, fully-distributed, and secure Postgres.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing pgEdge database by configuring your Hyperdrive connection with the database connection string.

### pgEdge Dashboard

1. Go to the [**pgEdge dashboard**](https://app.pgedge.com/databases) and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. In the **Connect to your database** section, copy the connection string for the `app` user that is displayed on the [`Nearest node` tab](https://docs.pgedge.com/cloud/database/manage_db#connect-to-your-database).

With the connection string, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

Move to a terminal window, and use the following command to [create a Hyperdrive](/hyperdrive/get-started/):

```sh
---
header: Create Hyperdrive
---
npx wrangler hyperdrive create pgedge --connection-string="pgedge_connection_string"
```

When the command completes, it will return information about the Hyperdrive, including the Hyperdrive UUID. Copy the ID, and update the `wrangler.toml` file to include the following information:

```toml
node_compat = true # required for the postgres connection

[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "hyperdrive_uuid"
```

## 4. Update the Cloudflare worker to Query pgEdge

Open the `src/index.ts` file, and update the code to include the following:

{{<render file="_query-pgedge.md">}}

After updating the file, use the following command to deploy the updates:

```sh
$ npx wrangler deploy
```

After completing these steps, you can use the Cloudflare Worker to query your Postgres database, provisioned and managed by pgEdge Cloud.
