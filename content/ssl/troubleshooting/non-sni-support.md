# Non-SNI support

If your visitors use older devices/browsers that do not have [Server Name Indication (SNI)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/) support, they may get `common name mismatch` errors when trying to access your website or application.

Consider the following options to avoid this problem.

## Custom certificates

Use [Custom certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/) with Legacy Client Support.

When you [upload a custom certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#upload-a-custom-certificate), you can specify a value of `Legacy` for its client support.

Unlike [Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) or [advanced certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/), Cloudflare does not manage issuance and renewal for custom certificates.

## Dedicated IPs (paid zones only)

If you need to enable non-SNI support for a **paid zone**, you can [contact Cloudflare Support](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/contacting-cloudflare-support) to enable **Dedicated IP** for your zone.

Since not having SNI means that the client is unable to specify its target hostname during the SSL/TLS handshake, when you make sure only one zone is served on a specific IP, this action prevents that sort of errors from happening.
    
Dedicated IPs can be used with [Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) or [advanced certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/).

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
Note that a dedicated IP is not the same as a [static IP](/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/#customize-cloudflare-ip-addresses). Dedicated IPs only serve one zone, but can eventually change. Static IPs, on the other hand, are contractually guaranteed to never change but can serve more than one zone.
