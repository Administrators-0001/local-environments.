    title: New KV Analytics API
    description: |-
      Workers KV now has a new [analytics API](/kv/observability/metrics-analytics/) that leverages the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/) used by many other Cloudflare products. The new analytics API provides per-account and per-namespace metrics on both operations and storage, including latency metrics for both read and write operations to Workers KV.

      The metrics queried by this API will power upcoming improvements to the Workers KV dashboard analytics.

      The legacy Workers KV [analytics REST API](/api/operations/workers-kv-request-analytics-query-request-analytics) will be turned off as of January 31st, 2025. Developers using this API will receive a series of email notifications prior to the shutdown of the legacy API.
