title: Move a domain between Cloudflare accounts

---

Cloudflare supports the transfer of domains between Cloudflare accounts when the source and target account both confirm the transfer. The transfer will result in the loss of all configurations and settings for the domain in the source account. Additionally, the target account will become responsible for domain renewals going forward.

To begin, navigate to the Support component of the Cloudflare dashboard. Select the category "Domain Transfer" and complete the form detailing the target account for the domain.

Cloudflare will review the request, contact you if there are any questions, and initiate the transfer. You will be assigned a support ticket to follow the progress.
