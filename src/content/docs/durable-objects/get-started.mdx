Durable Objects are a powerful way to build distributed and coordinated systems and are ideal for building real-time, collaborative and/or multiplayer applications using Workers.

Each Durable Object can be thought of as a stateful micro-server that can be horizontally scaled into millions (or more). Each Durable Object can then act as a coordinator, as a private database, and is isolated from other Durable Objects running the same code.

This guide will instruct you through:

1. Defining your first Durable Object in code
2. Communicating with Durable Objects from your Worker
3. Persisting data within an individual Durable Object
4. Deploying your Durable Object globally.

## Prerequisites

To continue:

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.
2. Install [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
3. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

## 1. Create a Worker

:::note 

Durable Objects require the [Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) before you can deploy.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account.
2. Go to **Workers & Pages** > **Plans**.
3. Select **Purchase Workers Paid** and complete the payment process to enable Durable Objects.

:::

You will access your Durable Object from a [Worker](/workers/). Your Worker application is an interface to interact with your Durable Object.

To create a Worker project, run:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"durable-object-starter"}
/>

Running `create cloudflare@latest` will install [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), the Workers CLI. You will use Wrangler to test and deploy your project.

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		one: "Hello World example",
		two: "Hello World Worker Using Durable Objects",
		three: "JavaScript / Typescript",
	}}
/>

This will create a new directory, which will include either a `src/index.js` or `src/index.ts` file to write your code and a [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file.



## 2. Define your Durable Object

TODO - define a DO

A Durable Object has three primary concepts:

1. A namespace, which acts as a container for your definition. A namespace might be used to separate "production" and "staging", or different applications across your teams.
1. The Durable Object definition, which defines the code that each individual Durable Object runs. There is one namespace per definition.
1. The concrete Durable Object instance (a stateful server) that is instantiated within a namespace. There can be tens of millions (or more) instances within a namespace.


If you have not already moved into the directory created in the previous step, change into it now:

```sh
cd durable-object-starter
``` 

Open the `src/index.ts` (if you chose TypeScript) or `src/index.js` (JavaScript) in your text editor.

<Tabs> 
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">

```ts
import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";

export class MyDurableObject extends DurableObject {
	constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {}
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">

```js
export class MyDurableObject {
	constructor(state, env) {}
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The code above:

TODO - break this down into bullet points

Your `MyDurableObject` class will have a constructor with two parameters. The first parameter, `state`, passed to the class constructor contains state specific to the Durable Object, including methods for accessing storage. The second parameter, `env`, contains any bindings you have associated with the Worker when you uploaded it.

Workers communicate with a Durable Object via the fetch API. Like a Worker, a Durable Object listens for incoming fetch events by registering an event handler. For a Durable Object, the fetch handler is defined as a method on the class.

Your file should now look like:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">

```js
export class MyDurableObject {
	constructor(state, env) {}

	async fetch(request) {
		return new Response("Hello World");
	}
}
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">

```ts
export class MyDurableObject {
	constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {}

	async fetch(request: Request) {
		return new Response("Hello World");
	}
}
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

A Worker can pass information to a Durable Object via headers, the HTTP method, the Request body, or the Request URI.

:::note

HTTP requests received by a Durable Object do not come directly from the Internet. HTTP requests come from other Workers and other Durable Objects. Durable Objects use HTTP for familiarity, but plan to introduce other protocols in the future.

:::

## 3. Configure Durable Object bindings

[Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to interact with resources on the Cloudflare developer platform. The Durable Object bindings in your Worker project's `wrangler.toml` will include a binding name (for this guide, use `MY_DURABLE_OBJECT`) and the class name (`MyDurableObject`).

```toml
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "MY_DURABLE_OBJECT"
class_name = "MyDurableObject"

# or

[durable_objects]
bindings = [
  { name = "MY_DURABLE_OBJECT", class_name = "MyDurableObject" }
]
```

The `[[durable_objects.bindings]]` section contains the following fields:

- `name` - Required. The binding name to use within your Worker.
- `class_name` - Required. The class name you wish to bind to.
- `script_name` - Optional. Defaults to the current [environment's](/durable-objects/reference/environments/) Worker code.

## 4. Configure Durable Object classes with migrations

A migration is a mapping process from a class name to a runtime state. You perform a migration when creating a new Durable Object class, or when renaming, deleting or transferring an existing Durable Object class.

Migrations are performed through the `[[migrations]]` configurations key in your `wrangler.toml` file.

The Durable Object migration to create a new Durable Object class will look like the following in your Worker's `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1" # Should be unique for each entry
new_classes = ["MyDurableObject"] # Array of new classes
```

Refer to [Durable Objects migrations](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/) to learn more about the migration process.

## 5. Access and create Durable Object instances

The `fetch()` handler allows you to instantiate and communicate to a Durable Object from a Worker.

:::note

Durable Objects do not receive requests directly from the Internet. Durable Objects receive requests from Workers or other Durable Objects.
This is achieved by configuring a binding in the calling Worker for each Durable Object class that you would like it to be able to talk to. These bindings must be configured at upload time. Methods exposed by the binding can be used to communicate with particular Durable Object instances.
:::

To communicate with a Durable Object, the fetch handler should look like the following:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		let id = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.idFromName(new URL(request.url).pathname);

		let stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.get(id);

		let response = await stub.fetch(request);

		return response;
	},
};
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">

```ts
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		let id = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.idFromName(new URL(request.url).pathname);

		let stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.get(id);

		let response = await stub.fetch(request);

		return response;
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

In the code above, you have:

1. Exported your Worker's main event handlers, such as the `fetch()` handler for receiving HTTP requests.
2. Passed `env` into the `fetch()` handler. Bindings are delivered as a property of the environment object passed as the second parameter when an event handler or class constructor is invoked. By calling the `idFromName()` function on the binding, you use a string-derived object ID. You can also ask the system to [generate random unique IDs](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-from-a-worker/#generate-ids-randomly). System-generated unique IDs have better performance characteristics, but require you to store the ID somewhere to access the Object again later.
3. Derived an object ID from the URL path. `MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.idFromName()` always returns the same ID when given the same string as input (and called on the same class), but never the same ID for two different strings (or for different classes). In this case, you are creating a new object for each unique path.
4. Constructed the stub for the Durable Object using the ID. A stub is a client object used to send messages to the Durable Object.
5. Forwarded the request to the Durable Object. `stub.fetch()` has the same signature as the global `fetch()` function, except that the request is always sent to the object, regardless of the request's URL. The first time you send a request to a new object, the object will be created for us. If you do not store durable state in the object, it will automatically be deleted later (and recreated if you request it again). If you store durable state, then the object may be evicted from memory but its durable state will be kept permanently.
6. Received an HTTP response back to the client with `return response`.

Refer to [Access a Durable Object from a Worker](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-from-a-worker/) to learn more about communicating to a Durable Object.

## 6. Test locally

To test your Durable Object locally, run [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev):

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

In your console, you should see a`Hello world` string returned by the Durable Object.

## 7. Deploy globally

To deploy your Durable Object Worker:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Once deployed, you should be able to see your newly created Durable Object Worker on the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), **Workers & Pages** > **Overview**.

Preview your Durable Object Worker at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.

By finishing this tutorial, you have successfully created, tested and deployed a Durable Object.
