TODO

- Workflows don't have to have a fixed number of steps
- Create them programatically, on the fly
- Define names and parameters
- Create steps in a loop or within a Promise


## Example

Steps can be created on-the-fly, allowing you create a step for each parameter passed to your Workflow, for each file you want to read from storage, or for calls to third-party APIs.

For example, you can loop over each event, label the step dynamically, and have the step operate only over that `event`:

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends Workflow<Env, Params> {
	async run(events: WorkflowEvent[], step: WorkflowStep) {
    // Dynamically create a step for each event passed to our workflow
    // ... or for every file we want to read from R2 storage
    // ... or each API call we need to make based on an incoming request
		for (const event of events) {
			await step.do(`processing ${event.id}`, async () => {
				// Step logic for one event goes here
				// You can also specify a StepConfig for each step, just as you
				// would for any other step
			})
		}
  }
}
```
