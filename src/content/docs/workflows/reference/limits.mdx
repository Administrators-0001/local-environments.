Limits that apply to authoring, deploying and running Workflows are detailed below. 

Many limits are inherited from those applied to Workers scripts and as documented in the [Workers limits](/workers/platform/limits/) documentation.

| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Workflow class definitions per script     | 1MB max script size per [Worker size limits](/workers/platform/limits/#account-plan-limits) | 1MB max script size per [Worker size limits](/workers/platform/limits/#account-plan-limits)
| Total scripts per account                 | 100 | 500 (shared with [Worker script limits](/workers/platform/limits/#account-plan-limits) |
| Compute time per Workflow                 | 10 seconds | 30 seconds of [active CPU time](/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time) |
| Duration (wall clock) per `step`          | Unlimited | Unlimited - e.g. waiting on network I/O calls or querying a database |
| Maximum persisted state per step          | 1MB (1e6 bytes) | 1MB (1e6 bytes) | 
| Maximum state that can be persisted per Workflow instance | 100MB | 1GB | 
| Maximum `step.sleep` duration             | 365 days (1 year) <beta>beta</beta> |
| Maximum steps per Workflow                | 256 <beta>beta</beta> |
| Maximum Workflow executions               | 100,000 per day [shared with Workers daily limit](/workers/platform/limits/#worker-limits) | Unlimited |
| Concurrent Workflow instances (executions) | 25 | 1,000 <beta>beta</beta> |
| Retention limit for completed Workflow state | 3 days | 30 days <sup>1</sup> |

<beta>beta</beta> This limit will be reviewed and revised during the open beta for Workflows, and we'll update this page and our changelog.

<sup>1</sup> Workflow state and logs will be retained for 3 days on the Workers Free plan and 30 days on the Workers Paid plan.
