D1 exposes database analytics that allow you to inspect query volume, query latency, and storage size across all and/or each database in your account.

The metrics displayed in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) charts are queried from Cloudflareâ€™s [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

D1 currently exports the below metrics:

| Metric                 | GraphQL Field Name        | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read Queries (qps)     | `readQueries`             | The number of read queries issued against a database. This is the raw number of read queries, and is not used for billing.            |
| Write Queries (qps)    | `writeQueries`            | The number of write queries issued against a database. This is the raw number of write queries, and is not used for billing.          |
| Rows read (count)      | `rowsRead`                | The number of rows read (scanned) across your queries. See [Pricing](/d1/platform/pricing/) for more details on how rows are counted. |
| Rows written (count)   | `rowsWritten`             | The number of rows written across your queries.                                                                                       |
| Query Response (bytes) | `queryBatchResponseBytes` | The total response size of the serialized query response, including any/all column names, rows and metadata. Reported in bytes.       |
| Query Latency (ms)     | `queryBatchTimeMs`        | The total query response time, including response serialization, on the server-side. Reported in milliseconds.                        |
| Storage (Bytes)        | `databaseSizeBytes`       | Maximum size of a database. Reported in bytes.                                                                                        |

Metrics can be queried (and are retained) for the past 31 days.
