description: Create a Worker with assets throught the wrangler CLI or through a Git integration.

import { Badge, Description, InlineBadge, Render } from "~/components";

Projects with assets can be created and edited using the [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/) or by connecting to your Worker Git provider[link to CI docs]. You cannot upload or edit a Worker with assets through the Cloudflare dashboard.

# Create a new application via CLI

## 1. Clone an existing Github repository

If you're building a static site, use this Github repository as a template to get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tanushree-sharma/workers-assets-template
```

If you're building a dynamic site, use this Github repository as a template to get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tanushree-sharma/workers-dynamic-assets-template
```

:::note
Will be moving this step to the C3 "clone from template" flow. There is currently a bug blocking this.

## 2. Develop locally

After you have created your Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to preview your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

### Routing

#### Static Site

Assets are served based on file based routing. Navigate to `yourdomain.dev/index.html`, in order serve the `index.html` file in your root directory. If a request is made to a path that does not match a file in your directory, Clouflare will respond with a 404.

Learn more about [routing configuration](/workers/frameworks/configuration/).

#### Dynamic Site

Similar to static sites, dynamic sites assets also follow file based routing. However, if a request is made to a path that does not match a file in your directory, instead of serving a 404, the request will be handled by the server-side code in your Worker.

Learn more about [routing configuration](/workers/frameworks/configuration/).

:::note
We are working on default config options. Once that is implemented, this default routing logic will change. Routing to yourdomain.dom will server inded.html by default.

## 3. Write code

Modify ayour Worker to build your application.

## 4. Deploy your Project

Deploy your Worker via Wrangler to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```
