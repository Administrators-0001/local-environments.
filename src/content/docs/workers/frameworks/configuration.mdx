# Static Sites

## Routing

:::note
We are working on default config options. Once that is implemented, this default routing logic will change.
:::

Static sites contain only static assets, without any server side JavaScript.

Assets are served based on file based routing. Any requests that don't match a file are unhandled and will lead to a 404 response. For example, take the following project:

wrangler.toml file:

```sh title="wrangler.toml"
name = "workers-static-assets"
compatibility_date = "2024-08-29"

[experimental_assets]
directory = "./public"
```

Directory structure:

<FileTree>
- …
- public
 - index.html
 - contact.html
 - blog
   - index.html
   - archive.html
</FileTree>

File based routing would map incoming paths to the following files:

| Incoming Request | File Served     |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| /index.html      | index.html      |
| /blog/index.html | blog/index.html |
| /                | 404             |
| /blog/archive    | 404             |

# Dynamic Sites

## Routing

Static sites contain static assets as well as server-side code to dynamically render webpages. Dynamic sites can take advantage of any Workers [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis) to build stateful, full-stack applications.

Requests are first served based on file based routing. Any requests that don't match a file will invoke your dynamic code. For example, take the following project:

wrangler.toml file:

```sh title="wrangler.toml"
name = "workers-dynamic-assets-template"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-08-29"

[experimental_assets]
directory = "./public"
name = ASSETS
```

Directory structure:

<FileTree>
- …
- public
 - index.html
 - contact.html
 - blog
   - index.html
   - archive.html
- src
  - index.js
</FileTree>

File based routing would map incoming paths to the following files:

| Incoming Request | File Served     |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| /index.html      | index.html      |
| /blog/index.html | blog/index.html |
| /                | index.js        |
| /blog/archive    | index.js        |
| /foo             | index.js        |

## Assets Binding

Your dynamic code can make or forward requests to your project’s static assets using the assets binding[link out to bindings page]. For example:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">
```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    if (url.pathname.startsWith('/api/')) {
      // TODO: Add your custom /api/* logic here.
      return new Response('Ok');
    }
    // Otherwise, serve the static assets.
    // Without this, the Worker will error and no assets will be served.
    return env.ASSETS.fetch(request);
  },
}
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
