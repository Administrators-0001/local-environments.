    title: Workflows is now in public beta.
    description: |-
      Workflows, a new product for building reliable, multi-step workflows using Cloudflare Workers, is now in public beta. The public beta is avaiable to any user with a [free or paid Workers plan](/workers/platform/pricing/).

      A Workflow allows you to define multiple, independent steps that encapsulate errors, automatically retry, persist state, and can run for seconds, minutes, hours or even days. A Workflow can be useful for post-processing data from R2 buckets before querying it, automating a [Workers AI RAG pipeline](/workers-ai/tutorials/build-a-retrieval-augmented-generation-ai/), or managing user signup flows and lifecycle emails.

      You can learn more about Workflows in [our announcement blog], or start building in our [get started guide].
