Most Workers are a variation on the default Workers flow:

<TypeScriptExample>
```ts
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		return new Response('Hello World!');
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```
</TypeScriptExample>

For Workers written in [ES modules syntax](/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/), when a request to your `*.workers.dev` subdomain or to your Cloudflare-managed domain is received by any of Cloudflare's data centers, the request invokes the [`fetch()` handler](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/) defined in your Worker code with the given request. You can respond to the request by returning a [`Response`](/workers/runtime-apis/response/) object.
