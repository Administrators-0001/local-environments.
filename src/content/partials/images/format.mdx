import { Tabs, TabItem } from "~/components"

Affects interpretation of `width` and `height`. All resizing modes preserve aspect ratio. Used as a string in Workers integration. Available modes are:

- `scale down`\
  Similar to `contain`, but the image is never enlarged. If the image is larger than given `width` or `height`, it will be resized. Otherwise its original size will be kept. Example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="URL format">
    ```js 
    fit=scale-down
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Workers">
  ```js 
  cf: {image: {fit: "scale-down"}}
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
